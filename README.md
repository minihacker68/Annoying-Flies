# Annoying-Flies

This is an arduino project that features annoying bugs and flies. (and glitches! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )

Before starting you will need:                                                 
       The Arduino IDE installed: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software                              
       This library installed: https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_HX8357                         
       An Arduino Mega 2560 with a lcd like this: https://www.banggood.com/3_2-Inch-320-X-480-TFT-LCD-Display-Module-Support-Arduino-Mega2560-p-963574.html?cur_warehouse=CN                        
       An SD card, for most of the pictures (they are too big to fit in flash memory)

There are 2 .zip files, download both on to your computer.

Extract the contents of 'Data files.zip' on to a SD card (preferably blank, about 9MB or more needed) so that there should now be a folder called 'ARDUINO'. Don't rename it or it's contents!!

Extract the contents of 'Flies.zip' so there is a folder called 'Flies'. It should be on your computer.

Open the folder called 'Flies' and open 'Flies.ino'. You should now have the Arduino IDE open with the sketch.

Change the board to 'Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560', change the serial port, and click upload. (The Arduino mega should be connected BEFORE doing this step & this is assuming you are on the latest version)

Wait for it to finish uploading, then disconnect the Arduino mega.

SAFELY eject the SD card, close the Arduino IDE, take out the card, then put it in the SD card slot on the TFT LCD shield.

Connect the Arduino to power and enjoy THE ANNOYING FLIES!
